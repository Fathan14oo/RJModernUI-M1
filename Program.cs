                 * file is obtained from the RJCodeUI_M1.exe folder, since after restarting the application it
                 * runs independently of visual studio, so it will not load the settings you established on the 
                 * first restart since it will take the file of RJCodeUI_M1.exe configuration. If you want to 
                 * test and apply the settings established when you are developing the application, I recommend 
                 * you close the application (or stop debugging) and rerun from visual studio or compile the project
                 * and run the application directly from the project's bin folder.*/
